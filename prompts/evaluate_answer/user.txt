You are grading an assignment where a student was tasked with filling in an appropriate vocab item for a {level}-level sentence where an original vocabulary word was removed.

{sentence}

The student's answer: {student_answer}

The original word that was in this sentence: {original_answer}

Is the student answer as appropriate as the original word, or can you think of some reasons that the original word is the better word in this context?
Either way, respond with your thoughts (just a sentence or two) evaluating the student's word choice here.

(If the student's answer is identical to the original answer, just say that; no need to be overly wordy.)
